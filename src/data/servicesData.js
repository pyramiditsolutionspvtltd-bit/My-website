    fullDescription: 'Fiber to the home (FTTH), also called “fibre to the premises” (FTTP), is the installation and use of optical fibre from a central point directly to individual buildings such as residences, apartment buildings and businesses to provide unprecedented high-speed Internet access. FTTH dramatically increases the connection speeds available to computer users compared with technologies now used in most places.While FTTH promises connection speeds of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) — 20 to 100 times as fast as a typical cable modem or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) connection — implementing FTTH on a large scale will be costly because it will require installation of new cable sets over the “last links” from existing optical fibre cables to individual users. Some communities currently enjoy “fibre to the curb” (FTTC) service, which refers to the installation and use of optical fibre cable to the curbs near homes or businesses, with a “copper” medium carrying the signals between the curb and the end usersPyramid aims at serving a one-stop complete set of solution for FTTH. We are proudly saying that we have successfully completed for “Abra” with 400 Flats and currently we are executing this technology for 2046 Flats in Hyderabad. Connectivity is no longer a luxury in this fast-paced dynamic world, rather it has become a necessity for everyone.
